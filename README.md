## Archon's Philosophy
Archon's philosophy gravitates alongside that of where the name originally came from, not just the literal meaning of the word (This is defined in the next paragraph), but what it relates to - Arch Linux. And, much like Arch, Archon empowers users through responsibility, it offers flexibility with its modular design - each are all optional, configurable, and independently maintainable, and willingly hands out transparency and user control with encouraged manual configuration.

The word “Archon” comes from ancient Greek, meaning “ruler” or “magistrate”. In classical Athens, an archon was a high-ranking official who had administrative, judicial, and sometimes military authority. The term literally conveys leadership, control, and authority.
