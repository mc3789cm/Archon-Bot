# Archon

During my time as an admin for a few Discord servers, and as a perfectionist, I always had the problem of not having enough customization, control, and/or configuration when trying to use a bot for the servers needs. And, even if I did, it would usually be behind a pay wall or the feature was limited to only a few uses/implementations. I.e only being able to setup a max of ten reaction roles.

I plan to make Archon (kind of what we call the terminal in Linux) a "power tool" with multitudes of configurations for each feature. And, it's up to the user/admin to configure and maintain it. Each module (feature) will be disabled by default, no bloat or unnecessary defaults, just a blank slate, everything greyed out—disabled with the task for you to fill in only what you need, no limits.

## Possible Features
> [!NOTE]
> These are only ideas, not affirmative plans.
- Advanced, user-friendly, and intuitive reaction roles<br/>
Reaction roles can be crucial for any server, even if it's just `click` and you're assigned an access role. That stops most bot accounts from entering your server, letting you take acction on it before your users become subject to them. I'll take this to a higher bar with inspiration from Tech's [Reaction Roles](https://reactionroles.mtdv.me/) bot.
- Visually customizable dashboard for easy configuration on all your servers.<br/>
Will probably be made with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
- Cron jobs/automation of any sorts<br/>
- Welcome/leave triggers<br/>
- Logging for almost every event<br/>
Events listed [Here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord-api-events).
- Leveling system<br/>
- Starboard<br/>
- Embeds<br/>
Inspiration from [Discohook Utils](https://discohook.app).
- Keep as much source-code openly viewable as securely possible.<br/>
- Much more

## Archon's Philosophy
Archon's philosophy gravitates alongside that of where the name was originally thought off of, not just the literal meaning of the word (This is defined in the next paragraph), but what it relates to - Arch Linux.

Much like Arch, Archon empowers users through responsibility, it offers flexibility with its modular design - each are all optional, configurable, and independently maintainable, and hands out transparency and user control with clear documentation (yet to be written) and encouraged manual configuration.

The word “Archon” comes from ancient Greek, meaning “ruler” or “magistrate”. In classical Athens, an archon was a high-ranking official who had administrative, judicial, and sometimes military authority. The term literally conveys leadership, control, and authority.
